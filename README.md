# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

I am an aspiring CS major hoping to specialize in the backend for web development. I am relatively new to programming but i've been doing good studying everyday and learning new concepts. For the first half of my 'career' i was coding in c++ trying to learn the basics, and while there is still much to learn pertaining to the language i feel like i know a good deal so id like to start branching off and start trying to learn new languages in relation to my major and goals. I want to get into DSA's and start learning new languages that will help me in my career.
